- 👋 Hi, I’m @davidk1401
- 👀 I’m interested in data, data analytics, data engineering, and how these can be used to gain insights, make predictions, and ultimately understand more about the world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, SQL, Excel, statistics and how to use these tools for data projects
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything! Feel free to contact me. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Google David Katilius. There's another guy with the same name who's a musician. That's not me. Otherwise I'm pretty easy to find. :)
